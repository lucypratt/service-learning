## Why Svelte?
I chose to use Svelte because out of all the frameworks we covered this semester, this one made the most sense to me. I like that creating components is so simple and it feels like the syntax/set up structure is much simpler. I also like that this "simple" feel made it easier for me to create a dynamic single webpage for my app using conditional logic.
